### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marielle and I'm a data scientist based in Berlin, Germany. In a past life, I was a learning sciences researcher (PhD), which means I combined theories from psychology and methods from computer science to understand how people learn.

In my free time, I organize coding workshops and talks for PyLadies Berlin and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) Berlin and contribute to Python open source projects.

I also really love cats :cat:, good food :rice: :ramen: :fries: and specialty coffee :coffee:
