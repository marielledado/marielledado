### Hi, I'm Marielle ðŸ‘‹ Check out my personal projects!

I'm a data engineer based in Berlin, Germany. In a past life, I was a learning sciences researcher (PhD), which means I combined theories from psychology and methods from computer science to understand how people learn.

I also really love cats :cat:, good food :rice: :ramen: :fries: and specialty coffee :coffee:
